# Full Stack API Final Project

## Trivia API

This API powers a web application which allows people to play Trivia. In this game, users can interact with the app by:

1. Previewing all existing questions and searching for specific ones
2. Adding new questions and deleting existing ones
3. Playing the game. Here the application randomly selects questions and takes an answer from the user, calculating their score based on how many questions they answered correctly


## Getting Started

### Installing Dependencies
#### Python 3.7
Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the python docs.

#### Virtual Environment
We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the python docs

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the /backend directory and running:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the requirements.txt file.

Key Dependencies:

1. Flask is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

2. SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py.

3. Flask-CORS is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server.

### Database Setup
With Postgres running, restore a database using the trivia.psql file provided. From the backend folder in terminal run:

`psql trivia < trivia.psql`

### Running the Server
From within the backend directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:

`export FLASK_APP=flaskr`

`export FLASK_ENV=development`

`flask run`

Setting the `FLASK_ENV` variable to `development` will detect file changes and restart the server automatically.

Setting the `FLASK_APP` variable to `flaskr` directs flask to use the `flaskr` directory and the `__init__.py` file to find the application.

### Frontend Dependencies
This project depends on Nodejs and Node Package Manager (NPM). Before continuing, you must download and install Node (the download includes NPM) from https://nodejs.com/en/download.
This project uses NPM to manage software dependencies. NPM Relies on the package.json file located in the frontend directory of this repository. After cloning, open your terminal and run:

`npm install`
#### Running your Frontend in Dev Mode
The frontend app was built using create-react-app. In order to run the app in development mode use npm start. You can change the script in the package.json file.

Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

`npm start`
## Testing
To run the tests, run:

`dropdb trivia_test`

`createdb trivia_test`

`psql trivia_test < trivia.psql`

`python test_flaskr.py`
